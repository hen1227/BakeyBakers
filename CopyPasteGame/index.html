	  <p>This app is for a really fun game. You can download it on IOS devices on the app store by searching "Copy Paste game" (the app name "Copy Paste" was taken)

	  <p>I learned the copy paste game in 8th grade. Before the app we would record our copies in the notes app. It wasn't until Covid picked up and we were put into quarantine that I got the idea of Fish's Tale. 
		  What better to test the method of storing data in JSON files and other features before starting Fish's Tale. Including all of the research I had to do to actuall learn how to code Swift 5 it took me
	  a few weeks. It was really basic but I was proud of my first app.</p>
	  <p>The next year, (1/2/21,) I published with my brand new licence. After I saw the popularity of it amongst my friends and family, I remade the whole app. I also added ads. Sorry, but the licence did cost $99.</p>
	  <p>It has more downloads then the app I spent months on. Hopefully that will change when fishing season comes.</p>
