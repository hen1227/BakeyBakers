			  <p>Copy and Paste is a really fun game that can should play with your friends.</p>
			  <p>The basics of the game is at any point someone can say "Copy" to copy the last phrase someone else said. 
				  Then at any time the person who said copy can say "Paste" and the copied person has to say the phrase. </p>
			  			  <p>If someone refuses to say the phrase then they lose all the copies they have on other people!</p>

			  
			  
			  <h4>The game is adaptable!</h4>
			  <p>You can change rules as you see fit. <b>As long as the group of people you play with are playing with are aware and agree with them. </b>
				  Also I should point this out, don't say paste if the person is incapible of speaking at the moment. Like if they are chewing or choking or screaming for their lives as they run from a bear.</p>
			 
			  
			  <p>Some homebrew rules you should try out:</p>
			<ul class="normal">
			  <li class="normal">One Copy per day</li>
			  <ul class="normal"><li class="normal">Or per hour</li></ul>
			  <li class="normal">Someone can only copy 10 seconds after the phrase is said</li>
			<li class="normal">Someone has to wait 10 seconds between each time saying "Paste"</li>
			<li class="normal">Allow the Phrase to be longer then one sentance</li>
				
			</ul>
