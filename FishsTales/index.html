				  <h1>Fish's Tale!</h1> 
				  <p>This app is for Fishing. You can download it on IOS devices on the app store by searching "Fish's Tale"
				  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/henry-abrahamsen/id1544660671">Or using this handy link.</a><p>
				  <p>I personally don't fish. But my brother does. Often I am the one driving him on the boat. I often found myself keeping track where the most were caught. 
				  I tried using paper but that didn't work. Then spread sheets but it was tedous to input lots of fish. At the start Quarentine I got the idea to make an app to track the fish.
				  My plan was to have an app with a map of the pond we had a camp at. I wanted it done by the time my brother started activly fishing during the summer. So I set my deadline to the end of school.
				  First I made the Copy Paste Game app to test my method of storing data. Although it was just a test, I ended up publishing it anyway. It can be found with the link above.
					  By the time I got to my deadline, I had everything I wanted. But at that point I was having so much fun making it I deciced to keep adding to it. Feature after feature I kept going all summer long.
					  School starting deffinently slowed my progress but I have now not only finished but I have pulished it!</p>
				  <p>The app now supports any location, any lure, any fish, any angler! I have even taken advantage of uuids (Universal Unique Identifier). They allow the app to have multiple objects with the same name. 
				  Also I actually managed to be able to rename items as well, a challange I have been struggling with for quite some time.</p>
