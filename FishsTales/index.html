				  <h1>Fish's Tale!</h1> 
			  <p>Welcome!
My name is Henry Abrahamsen. I am a freshman at Cape Elizabeth High School and developed an app called Fish's Tale. I started this app when the world went on lockdown with the COVID pandemic. You can find it by searching "Fish's Tale" on the Apple App Store or by clicking on this link. 

It is a complex app. The main idea is to track where fish are most often caught by recording data. You can easily discover which spot or lure, or water depth works the best for any fishing hole using the app. I am super proud of it! I made it for my older brother and dad, who love to fish. If I join them, I drive the boat while they troll, and I like to track what types of fish are caught in different locations. But keeping a paper journal wasn't easy on the water, and it contained lists of unfiltered data. While the app helps anglers catch more fish, it also allows data geeks like me to monitor and record overall trends.

To make this app, I decided to try Swift so I could gain more experience using XCode.

I stretched myself to code in a language I did not know at the onset of this project. While I previously used Xcode, only in Object C and nothing more complicated than a game of Tic Tac Toe. So far, I've coded computer apps, 3D, 2D, Google Chrome extensions, and robots for Vex Robotics! As you can probably tell, most of the things I have made have yet to be high quality for distribution. My main objective has been to gain an understanding of the different programs so that when I'm inspired to create an app, I'll mostly know what to do and will be generally familiar with the layout and requirements. I also strive to learn how to code in diverse programs. 

To learn Swift, I watched a few tutorials and used my previous coding knowledge to slowly understand the language. I also initially coded a basic app (called Copy Paste and found on this website) to test different methods of saving data. This allowed me to figure out the best plan for my app.

To use my app Fish's Tale is quite straightforward. The moment you enter the app, you're immediately on a page that records your catch. Entering data is easy to access. You can add as little or as much information as you want - such as the type of fish caught, the lure or fly that was used, the person who caught it, the location, date, the distance of line, weight, and length of fish, and the temperature of both air and water. Once all the information is entered, you press "reel in" to finish. This saves the data onto a JSON file on the user's local device. This way the app can be used without a cellular connection.

Over the summer, there were three main concepts I focused on. First and most importantly, I wanted to minimize the limitations of the app. For example, I didn't want to update the app with new lures and flies every year, but I also didn't want the user to be annoyed with missing options. So I decided to make it dynamic. This means that the user can add, delete and edit information, so it's customized for their use. They can add types of lures and flies, as well as types of fish, anglers, and locations. When choosing a location, the user can select whether it is a pond, lake, river, or ocean. This makes the app available to a broader audience.  

Second, I wanted the database to be searchable. I didn't want all the data in just a list, so I added a filter feature. This feature allows the data to be searched by certain criteria. For example, who caught the most or how many fish have been caught collectively in a particular area. I initially struggled with adding this feature, but it worked after implementing UUIDs or Universal Unique Identifiers. Storing information this way makes it possible for the data to be renamed and will make it easier to share the information with a database in the future.

Third, I wanted it to look good on all devices. This may seem basic and obvious, but I actually found it challenging to make all the data fit on my iPhone 5s and also look good on my brother's iPhone 11. 

As funny as it may sound coming from someone who coded an app for fishing, I personally don't fish. So when I needed advice on what aspects my app should include, I asked my brother and his friends. One suggestion was an option to switch the distance of the line between feet and colors for trolling because the color of fishing lines changes every 30 feet so anglers can easily calculate the length of the line. While adding it, I also included an option for the user to switch to the metric system. These settings are found in the 4th tab, with all the user preferences, including dark mode.

This was my first complex coding project. Going forward, I will be more organized and mindful when naming items. Because I coded this app over several months, there are many discontinuities in the code regarding variable and file names. I also had to change my method of saving the data several times because I would find a better technique or realize that the previous process didn't work with a new feature I wanted to add, so my code is not as clean as I would like it to be.

Overall, I am excited to test my app this summer. I finished coding it in December and haven't had a chance to really use or perfect it.

					  That app is called "Copy Paste Game." It is an app for a game my sister taught my brothers and me after playing with college friends. How it works is, your friends can say "copy" on anything that you say. 
					  (Usually, it's something random or funny.) Later, they can say "paste" at a time of their choosing, and you have to repeat whatever they previously copied on you.
					  All the app does is keep track of who you have copies on and the copied quotes. It isn't that impressive, but I figured I should share it.
