				  <h1>Fish's Tale!</h1> 
				  <p>You can find the app I have spent most of quarantine developing by searching "Fish's Tale" on the Apple App Store or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/henry-abrahamsen/id1544660671">by clicking this link</a>. 
					  It is a complex app. The main idea is to track where fish are most often caught by recording data. 
					  Using the app, you can easily discover which spot or lure or water depth works the best for any fishing hole. I am super proud of it! I made it for my older brother who loves to fish.

<!-- 				  <p>Since I have an Apple Developer Program license, I also decided to publish an app that I made to test a method of storing data that I coded prior to developing Fish's Tale. 
					  That app is called "Copy Paste Game." It is an app for a game my sister taught my brothers and me after playing with college friends. How it works is, your friends can say "copy" on anything that you say. 
					  (Usually, it's something random or funny.) Later, they can say "paste" at a time of their choosing, and you have to repeat whatever they previously copied on you.
					  All the app does is keep track of who you have copies on and the copied quotes. It isn't that impressive, but I figured I should share it. 

</p> -->
				  <p>I have stretched myself to code very diverse programs. 
					  I've coded computer apps, 3D, 2D, Google Chrome extensions, robot “brains” for Vex Robotics, and now the iPhone! As you can probably tell, most of the things I have made aren't high quality for distribution.
					  My main objective has been to gain an understanding of the different programs so that if I ever get inspiration for an app or game I really want to make, I’ll mostly know what to do and will be generally familiar with the layout and requirements.
