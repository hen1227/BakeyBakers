	     <h1>BakeyBakers life</h1>
			<p>I first started when I wanted a bake sale, but I thought our fold-out tables were too dirty. My mom offered if I gave her the next two hundred dollars I make from the Bake Sale
         She would make me a cart that I could use. On my first Bake Sale, I thought it was fun, so jokingly started calling it "Bakey Bakers.". I now own a website called BakeyBakers.com.</p>

			     <p>I am sorry for the pain in reading that sentance I wrote in 6th grade... writing isn't really my strong suit. A more gramaticly correct story (9th grade): </p>
			     <BR>
			<BR>
				<pBakeybakers has been quite a journey. It seems that I can't settle on a genre to hone in on. In truth, all of the stuff I publish is the work that I had fun creating. Whether it is a Youtube video
			or a game if I didn't enjoy the process then my heart wasn't in it. I want to not only be proud of the outcome or how I got there. That is part of the reason I don't use bootstrap on this website. I want the stuff
			here to be mine, or at least I learned it from w3schools and understood it.</p>
				<BR>
				<p>In fifth grade, I was intrigued by the idea of having a business and being able to put my profits back into the business to make it better. I had one successful bake sale and when I packed up my stuff
			and asked my mom to get a better stand. I gave her the money I had earned and she built me a beautiful stand. I was at about $180 in debt. I doubt she was expecting me to pay it back but I did. I spent a couple of weekends,
			occasionally with a friend, and got the money to her. I was so happy and proud of myself. I had made no money but I was out of debt. It took me all of a week before investing in a tiny gumball machine.</p>
					<BR>
				<p>I held another couple of stands and made a small profit but it was around this time I got a laptop. I had been experimenting in making websites but nothing more than just hello world and 
					buttons that showed a joke. I talked to a couple of friends who had an actual website and I started my Bakeybakers website. I didn't really know what to have on it and for about a month it was just the "BakeyBakers Life"
				section above. It was this time when I took a coding class on an app called processing. I loved it! In between the weekly classes I was really simple things like a ball that bounced around the screen. I quickly got ahead of the class
				and started making my own games and spent the class coding my games. The class did teach me things I couldn't find wiki pages on. I felt that I was actually creating something. If only there was a way to put these games on
				my website. That is when I learned about The Coding Train.</p>
