			<p>I first started when I wanted a bake sale, but I thought our fold-out tables were too dirty. My mom offered if I gave her the next two hundred dollars I make from the Bake Sale
         She would make me a cart that I could use. On my first Bake Sale, I thought it was fun, so jokingly started calling it "Bakey Bakers.". I now own a website called BakeyBakers.com.</p>

Anyway, my website started to promote my bake stand but changed with me as my interest moved from baking to coding to animation to back to coding. It's a reflection of my work. 
				<p>Bakeybakers has been quite a journey. It seems that I can't settle on a genre to hone in on. In truth, all of the stuff I publish is the work that I had fun creating. Whether it is a Youtube video
			or a game if I didn't enjoy the process then my heart wasn't in it. I want to not only be proud of the outcome or how I got there. That is part of the reason I don't use bootstrap on this website. I want the stuff
			here to be mine, or at least I learned it from w3schools and understood it.</p>

				<p>In fifth grade, I was intrigued by the idea of having a business and putting my profits back into the business to make it better. I had one successful bake sale on a dirty fold-out table at the corner of our street. 
					My first bake sale was so much fun, so I jokingly started calling it "Bakey Bakers” and I wanted to do it again, but better. I asked my mom about an official stand. I wanted to be more professional. 
					I gave her the money I had earned, and she built me a beautiful stand. I was about $160 in debt. I doubt she was expecting me to pay it back, but I eventually did. I spent many weekends and after school, occasionally with a friend, selling at my stand.
					I even hired friends to help with marketing and baking goods. Kind of obnoxious now looking back, but I had a Square to collect payment. I didn't like neighbors saying wish they could get something – if only they had available cash! 
					I was in 5th grade, and basically, my lemonade stand accepted credit cards. </p>
					<BR>
				<p>I was so happy and proud of myself when I paid my mom back for the stand (Okay, she helped a little with the use of free ingredients.) It felt good to be profitable and out of debt. I even invested in a tiny gumball machine to help raise revenue. 
					I held another couple of stands and made a small profit, but it was around this time my grandpa gave me my first laptop. It was a basic model from Target. I had been experimenting in making websites but nothing more than just hello world and buttons that showed a joke.
					I talked to a couple of friends who had an actual website on how to create my own. Within a short period, I started my Bakeybakers website. I didn't really know what to have on it, and for about a month, it was just the "BakeyBakers Life" section above.
					It was this time when I took an afterschool coding class on an app called Processing. I loved it! In between the weekly classes, I created simple things like a ball that bounced around the screen. 
					I quickly got ahead of the course and started making my own games, and spent the class coding my games. The course did teach me things I couldn't find on Wiki pages. I felt that I was actually creating something. If only there were a way to put these games on my website.
					That is when I learned about The Coding Train.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I never want to miss a chance to support him, he trully changed my life</p>
						<br>
						<p>https://thecodingtrain.com/</p>
						<p>https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/</p>
						<br>
						<p>He practically taught me how to code. I never would be anywhere I am today if it weren't for him. That is a lot of story, there is a lot I have not talked about like my Stop Motion animations. </p>
