	     <h1>BakeyBaker's Story</h1>
			<p>I first started when I wanted a bake sale, but I thought our fold-out tables were too dirty. My mom offered if I gave her the next two hundred dollars I make from the Bake Sale
         She would make me a cart that I could use. On my first Bake Sale, I thought it was fun, so jokingly started calling it "Bakey Bakers.". I now own a website called BakeyBakers.com.</p>

			     <h4>I am sorry for the pain caused by reading that passage I wrote in 6th grade... writing isn't really my strong suit. A more grammatically correct story (9th grade): </h4>
			<BR>
				
				<p>Bakeybakers has been quite a journey. It seems that I can't settle on a genre to hone in on. In truth, all of the stuff I publish I had fun creating. Whether it is a Youtube video or a game, if I didn't enjoy the process then my heart wasn't in it.
					I want not only to be proud of the outcome, but how I got there. That mindset is part of the reason why I don't use bootstrap on this website.
					I want the stuff posted there to be mine, or at least what I learned how to do from w3schools and understood it.</p>
				<BR>
				<p>In fifth grade, I was intrigued by the idea of having a business and putting my profits back into the business to make it better. I had one successful bake sale on a dirty fold-out table at the corner of our street. 
					My first bake sale was so much fun, so I jokingly started calling it "Bakey Bakers.” I wanted to do it again, but better. I asked my mom about an official lemonade stand so I could be more professional than a fold out table.
					I gave her the money I had earned, and she helped me build a beautiful stand. I was about $160 in debt. I doubt she ever expected me to pay her back, but I eventually did. I spent many weekends and after school, occasionally with a friend, selling at my stand. 
					I even hired friends to help with marketing and baking goods. Kind of obnoxious now looking back, but I had a Square to collect payment. I didn't like neighbors saying they wish they could get something – if only they had available cash! I was in 5th grade, and basically, my lemonade stand accepted credit cards.
</p>
					<BR>
				<p>I was so happy and proud of myself when I paid my mom back for the stand (okay, she helped a little with the use of free ingredients.) It felt good to be profitable and out of debt. I even invested in a tiny gumball machine to help raise revenue. 
					I held a few more sales, but it was around this time my grandpa gave me my first laptop. It was a basic model from Target. I had been experimenting in making websites on and off since I was little, but nothing more than just hello world and buttons that showed a joke. 
					I talked to a couple of friends who shared an actual website on how to create my own. Within a short period, I started my BakeyBakers website. I didn't really know what to have on it, and for about a month, it was just the "BakeyBakers Story'' section above. </p>
						<br>
						<p>It was this time when I took an after school coding class on an app called Processing. I loved it! In between the weekly classes, I created simple things like a ball that bounced around the screen. I quickly got ahead of the course and started making my own games, and spent the class coding my games. 
							The course did teach me things I couldn't find on Wiki pages. I felt that I was actually creating something. If only there were a way to put these games on my website. That is when I learned about The Coding Train with Daniel Shiffman. He taught me how to code in p5js.
							It is practically the same as processing but javascript based, which can be put on my website.</p>
						
						<br>
						<p>I never want to miss a chance to support him, he truly changed my life!</p>
						<p><a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">His Website</a>
						<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/">And his amazing Youtube Channel</a></p>
						<p>That is a lot of the story, but there is also a lot I have not talked about like my Stop Motion animations. Anyway, my website started as a way to promote my bake stand but changed with me as my interest moved from baking to coding to animation and then back to coding. It's a reflection of my interests over the years.</p>
